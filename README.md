# DS-2020

This repository was created to show projects related specifically to the Data Mining course taught at the National University of Colombia
in the Spring-Semester of 2020. Even though, you can also find assignments related to statistics courses already checked by qualified
professors who were teaching courses in the field of Data Science(Statistics).

In a nutshell, this is a Data Science repository for free access and entertainment. Let me know how we can help you!
